# Introduction to Machine Learning: Linear Regression

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning: Linear Regression** module! This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on introduction to linear regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using the Boston housing dataset.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the following key steps:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing (checking for missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and the target variable
- Training a linear regression model to predict housing prices
- Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score
- Visualizing the actual vs. predicted results

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Linear-Regression.git
    cd ML-Linear-Regression
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `linear_regression.ipynb` to explore the code and execute the cells.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Data Description

We are using the Boston housing dataset from `scikit-learn`, which includes the following:

- **Features**: Various attributes of houses in Boston, such as the number of rooms, age, distance to employment centers, etc.
- **Target**: `MEDV` (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s).

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the notebook:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the Boston housing dataset provided by `scikit-learn`.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Check for missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
4. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using the selected features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
6. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's predictions against actual values.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The notebook demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using the `scikit-learn` library and evaluate its performance using common metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (R2) Score**: Indicates how well the model fits the data (1.0 indicates a perfect fit).

## Results Visualization

The results are visualized using a scatter plot that compares the actual vs. predicted values of the target variable, providing insights into the model's performance.
