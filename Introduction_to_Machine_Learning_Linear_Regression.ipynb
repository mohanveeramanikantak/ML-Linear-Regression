        "Linear regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in machine learning. It is a supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The goal of linear regression is to find the linear relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable).\n",
        "In this module, we provide a comprehensive introduction to linear regression through a practical, hands-on approach using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment. We use the Boston housing dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning, to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, proximity to employment centers, and more.\n",
